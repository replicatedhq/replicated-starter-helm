Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}. Your release is named: {{ .Release.Name }}.
It may take several minutes for your deployment to start up.

{{- if .Values.determined.useNodePortForMaster }}

You have configured Determined to deploy the master with a NodePort service. To make the
Determined master accessible from outside the cluster you will likely need to configure
an Ingress for: determined-master-service-{{ .Release.Name }}.

To have Determined configure an externally accessible load balancer for the
maser, please set "Values.useNodePortForMaster" to false.
{{ else }}

The IP address of the Determined master is the external IP of determined-master-service-{{ .Release.Name }},
which you can lookup by running (it may take a few minutes for the ip address to be assigned):

kubectl get service determined -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

{{ end -}}

ERROR: Installing a non-released version of Determined: {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}.
Determined does not publish Docker images for non-release version; attempts to
install a non-release version will lead to a `ImagePullBackOff` error.
Please update `appVersion` in Chart.yaml to an official release version in the
format X.Y.Z (e.g., 0.13.6).
